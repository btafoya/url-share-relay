# Privacy Policy — URL Share Relay

Last updated: 2026-09-05

URL Share Relay is a share-target utility. It does not collect, store, or
transmit any personal data.

## What the app does

When you share a link to URL Share Relay from another app, it:

1. Extracts the URL from the shared text.
2. Downloads the linked page's HTML directly from the URL's own server, over
   your device's normal internet connection.
3. Reads the page's title, description, and image metadata so you can review
   or edit it.
4. Lets you share the result on to another app of your choosing.

## What data is collected

None. Specifically:

- No analytics or tracking SDKs.
- No accounts, sign-in, or user identifiers.
- No advertising.
- No data is sent to any server operated by the developer — there is no
  backend.
- Nothing is stored on the device beyond normal Android app memory during a
  single use.

## Network access

The app requests the `INTERNET` permission solely to fetch the HTML of the
URL you share to it, so it can read that page's title/description/image.
That request goes directly from your device to the website you shared —
never through a server controlled by the developer.

## Third parties

The app has no third-party integrations. Fetching a URL you provide
necessarily contacts that URL's own server; the developer has no visibility
into, or control over, what that server does with the request.

## Changes

Any changes to this policy will be posted in this file.
